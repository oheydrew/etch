@oheydrew's Etch-a-sketch project. Learning stuff. This is a braindump log of
each session. Consider it "notes".

Log 3 - 16/06/17) - OK. 6 hours today and I have jack-all in the way of ACTUAL
CODE but I've learned a whole heap, from div elements through to CSS grid
techniques, the new CSS3 GRID style, older flexbox styles and right back to good
ol' Tables. Done for today, but plan to get back into it tomorrow. Will use CSS3
Grids as they're *so hot right now*. If I want back-compatibility maybe I'll
stretch-goal to make it again using tables. That'd teach me something about
backward compatibility stuff, too.

Log 2 - 16/06/17) - 4 hours in and already a bit lost. Realised everything is a
bit daunting at this stage. Need to break it down.

So: I need to make an etch-a-sketch. This is a JS exercise, so I need JS to
create most my elements, essentially. That's the brief. So
 - Create a 16x16 (variable?) Grid of <div>'s
   - Grid will be ordered by Row, with 16 Columns? Essentially a heap of
     separate Div's nested in each Row Div.
     - Still hazy on how to make Div's span horizontally vs vertically, need to
       read up on divs? Classes?

 - Determine whether the mouse is within a grid cell. That cell will need to
   change colour. According to predetermined colour etc

Ok. Time to read up on Div elements.

Log 1 - 16/06/17) - @oheydrew. "Etch-a-sketch" Odinproject CSS site. WIP, blank
slate. Having to brush up on simple HTML + CSS, but it's happening.

The whole point of this is to get myself used to using the tools. As such,
I'm making myself use:  

- unix terminal for all file manipulation
- atom for editing
- git to keep track + version control
- google inspector for inspectin'
- MDN and other docs for .js queries

*phew*. Here goes.
